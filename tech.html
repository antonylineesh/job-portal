     <h2>Read technical books</h2>   	
<p>One of the best ways to improve your technical skills is by reading books. As a teenager I used to buy computer books at the local bookstore. Today it’s far better to shop online because you can more easily find the true gems and avoid the lemons. Visit Amazon.com, search for a book on a particular topic you wish to learn, and check the reviews and ratings. Look for books with at least 4 out of 5 stars (I usually don’t buy any with less than 4.5 stars). Take advantage of Amazon’s browsing features to quickly find the best books in any field.</p>

<p>Even when you opt to buy technical books locally (such as for an easy return if it doesn’t suit you), you can still check the online reviews to rule out the bad ones. Take your time previewing books in the bookstore or online, especially if cost is a concern. If you can’t understand the first chapter, don’t waste your money.</p>

<p>Although technical books can be expensive and are often padded with lengthy code listings and other fluff, the good ones make up for it with clearly organized, well-edited, well-indexed content. Books in their second edition or later are a great choice because they’ve already been through at least one round of testing in the marketplace.</p>




<h2>Read online tutorials</h2>
<p>
<p>
   The advantage of online tutorials over books is that they’re accessible, timely, and of course free. The disadvantage is that they usually aren’t professionally edited, which can leave them lacking in completeness and/or clarity. However, they often sport other features like abundant interlinking, user comments, and interactive demos. Sometimes the comments are better than the original information, since they can contain lots of additional tips and suggestions. I find this is particularly true of reference sites like php.net (a reference site for PHP).</p>

<p>My favorite way of finding online tutorials is to use Google. If I need a CSS tutorial, I’ll search on CSS tutorial. I usually find something halfway decent in the top 5 results this way. Other variations that work well include how to XXX, XXX reference, and simply XXX, where XXX is whatever you wish to learn.</p>

<h2>Hang out with geeks</h2>
<p>

If you spend enough time with technical people, some of their knowledge will rub off on you. Even geeks learn from other geeks, but if you aren’t much of a geek yourself, a great way to accelerate the development of your technical skills is to join a local computer club or users group. Use APCUG (Association of Personal Computer User Groups) to find a group near you. Such groups usually welcome new members of any skill level. Contact one of them and attend a meeting as a guest to see if you like it.</p>

</p>Once you join a computer club or other geek-ridden association, volunteering is a great way to make fast friends. These nonprofit associations are frequently in need of volunteers for committee and project work; even if your technical skills are weak, they often just need raw manpower. When I decided to become active in the Association of Software Professionals during the late 90s, I put a lot of energy into volunteering. I wrote articles for their newsletter and served a year each as vice-president and president of the association. It was a lot of work to be sure, but I learned a great deal from working closely with the other volunteers. Many of those lessons have proven invaluable in running this personal development web site. In fact, writing those articles, which gradually became less technical and more motivational, contributed to my 2004 career switch from software development to personal development.
</p>

<h2>Subscribe to technical magazines</h2>

<p>
Technical magazines used to be one of my favorite outlets for learning, but I cancelled all my magazine subscriptions years ago. During the early 80s, I spent many long hours typing in BASIC programs from Family Computing and similar magazines (it took me a long time because I hadn’t yet learned to type). While I think print magazines are less useful today — the same info can often be found online for free — they’re an inexpensive way to improve your general technical skills, especially if you’re unlikely to push yourself in other ways. The professional editing and experienced writers are a big plus.
</p>
<h2>Take classes</h2>

<p>If group learning is your thing, look for college extension courses and other classroom and workshop offerings in your area. Periodically I get catalogs in the mail from UNLV, and while I lived in Los Angeles, I received them from UCLA, Learning Tree University, Pierce College, Santa Monica College, and others.</p>

<p>A key advantage of classroom learning is the opportunity to interact with an experienced educator. Teachers with decades of experience know plenty of educational distinctions you won’t find in books or online tutorials. And unlike many technical writers, they know how to teach.</p>
